--- abstract

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list furthers the
development and specification of Internet technology through discussion of
technical issues, and hosts discussions of IETF direction, policy, meetings, and
procedures.  As this is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable
latitude is allowed. Advertising, whether to solicit business or promote
employment opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable topics, as
do discussions of a personal nature.

This document obsoletes RFC3005.

--- note_Note_to_Readers

Discussion of this draft takes place on the [GENDISPATCH working group mailing
list](mailto:gendispatch@ietf.org), which is archived at
[](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/gendispatch/).

Working Group information can be found at
[](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/gendispatch/); source code and the issues
list for this draft can be found at [](https://github.com/larseggert/bcp45bis).

# Introduction

The IETF discussion list, ietf@ietf.org, serves two purposes.  It furthers the
development and specification of Internet technology through discussion of
technical issues.  It also hosts discussions of IETF direction, policy,
meetings, and procedures.  As this is the most general IETF mailing list,
considerable latitude is allowed. Advertising, whether to solicit business or
promote employment opportunities, falls well outside the range of acceptable
topics, as do discussions of a personal nature.

# Charter for the IETF Discussion List

This list is meant for initial discussion only.  Discussions that fall within
the area of any working group or well established list should be moved to such
more specific forum as soon as this is pointed out, unless the issue is one for
which the working group needs wider input or direction.

In addition to the topics noted above, appropriate postings include:

- Last Call discussions of proposed protocol actions
- Discussion of technical issues that are candidates for IETF work, but do not
  yet have an appropriate e-mail venue
- Discussion of IETF administrative policies
- Questions and clarifications concerning IETF meetings
- Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are sponsored or
  endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.

Inappropriate postings include:

- Unsolicited bulk e-mail
- Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings, activities, or
  technical concerns
- Unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject
- Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not sponsored or
  endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.

# Security Considerations

The IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director, or a sergeant-at-arms appointed by
the Chair is empowered to restrict posting by a person, or of a thread, when the
content is inappropriate and represents a pattern of abuse.  They are encouraged
to take into account the overall nature of the postings by an individual and
whether particular postings are an aberration or typical.  Complaints regarding
their decisions should be referred to the IAB.

# IANA Considerations

This document does not require any IANA actions.
